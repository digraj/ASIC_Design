How are the image files different? Does this make sense given the filter design built in the lab? Why or why not?
	Ans: The amount of filteration is different. Only lets colors with less value (Black: 0000, white: FFFF) to pass through. Colors with high values are filtered. As we change the coefficients, the tolerance of the high-pass 		     filter changes. Therefore, it makes sense.
